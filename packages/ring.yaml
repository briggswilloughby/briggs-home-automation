# =============================================================================
# PACKAGE: ring.yaml
# PURPOSE: Ring ding â†’ flash Shelly shelves + play chime on Kitchen & Patio Sonos
# FIX: Launch Sonos chime asynchronously before Shelly flash for quicker audio start.
#
# DEPENDS ON:
#   - Pyscript doorbell module (pyscript/apps/doorbell.py)
#   - Sonos players: media_player.kitchen, media_player.patio
#   - File at /config/www/dingdong.mp3 (served via media-source://media_source/local/dingdong.mp3)
#
# NOTES:
#   - The doorbell ding flow now lives in pyscript/apps/doorbell.py and exposes
#     pyscript.sonos_doorbell_chime_py + pyscript.shelves_doorbell_flash_py services.
#   - Legacy YAML automation/scripts were removed once the Pyscript handler became
#     authoritative to prevent duplicate flows.
# =============================================================================

# Intentionally left empty; see pyscript/apps/doorbell.py for the live implementation.
