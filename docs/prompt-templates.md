# Prompt Templates

This file collects reusable prompt templates to guide collaboration between **Management** and **Implementation** tracks, and to ensure consistent quality when generating or fixing YAML, scripts, and automations.

## ðŸŸ¢ YAML Fix Template (Full Version)

You are my HA/YAML expert. I will paste my complete current file.

Step 1: Diagnose whatâ€™s wrong â€” explain likely causes of the issue. Donâ€™t fix yet.
Step 2: Propose how to fix it â€” include design notes, trade-offs, and why your change solves the problem.
Step 3: Output the complete corrected file, file-ready (so I can drop it in directly).

Constraints:

[List state/attributes that must be preserved].

Observed behavior: [paste what happened].

Expected behavior: [paste what should happen].

Extra: If possible, explain how I can debug this (logs, Developer Tools, entity states) to confirm it works.

## ðŸ“Œ Usage Notes
- Always paste the **full file** when asking for fixes.  
- Explicitly state **Observed vs Expected behavior**.  
- Use **Management â†’ Implementation sync** to pass roadmap updates into Implementation.  
- Use **Implementation â†’ Management sync** to pass delivered work back into the roadmap.  
- Expect file-ready YAML/scripts, not snippets.
